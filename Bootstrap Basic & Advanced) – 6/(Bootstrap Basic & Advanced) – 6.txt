  ans:-  Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 are both popular front-end frameworks that offer a set of CSS and JavaScript 
         components for building responsive and mobile-friendly websites. While they share similarities, there are 
         several key differences between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5. Here are some of the notable differences:

         File Structure:  Bootstrap 5 introduces a simplified and more modular file structure compared to Bootstrap 4. 
                          The reliance on jQuery, a JavaScript library, has been removed in Bootstrap 5, resulting in 
                          a lighter and more streamlined framework.

         Default Typography: Bootstrap 5 adopts a new default typography system called "RFS" (Responsive Font Sizes). 
                             RFS allows for more flexible and responsive text scaling across different devices and 
                             screen sizes, providing better readability and user experience.

         Utility Classes:    Bootstrap 5 enhances its utility classes to provide more control and flexibility. 
                             It introduces new utility classes such as .gap for managing the spacing between elements, 
                             .col for column sizing, and .ratio for aspect ratios. These utility classes simplify common 
                             layout tasks and reduce the need for custom CSS.

         New Components:     Bootstrap 5 introduces several new components, including the offcanvas component for 
                             creating sidebars and modal dialogues, a redesigned navbar component, and a new spinner 
                             component for displaying loading indicators. It also provides updated versions of existing 
                             components, such as the dropdown and carousel.

       Improved Grid System: Bootstrap 5 improves upon the existing grid system in Bootstrap 4. It introduces a new CSS 
                             Grid-based layout system as an alternative to the traditional Flexbox-based grid. The new grid 
                             system offers more control over column placement and simplifies the creation of complex layouts.

       Customization:        Bootstrap 5 places a greater emphasis on customization and allows developers to tailor the 
                             framework to their specific needs more easily. It provides a new custom.scss file where developers 
                             can override default variables and customize the framework's styles more efficiently.
